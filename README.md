## Deployment

1. Configure project to use GitHub pages
    * Settings > Pages
    * Choose default branch and save
2. Create an empty `.nojekyll` file in the root folder
3. Create a folder called `.github` in the root folder and create a folder `workflows` inside the `.github` folder.
4. Create a `.yml` file for defining the build and deploy process and place it inside `.github/workflows`. See `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`.
